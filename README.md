Real Options Analysis in Go

This model is an example of how approximate dynamic programming can be used to value 
real options using Monte Carlo simulation. The example here is based on Schwartz (2004).
It uses two sources of uncertainty, the future net sales cash flow and the total investment 
cost, to estimate a continuation value in each period and along each simulation run. This 
continuation value then determines the decision of whether to investment in the current
time period.
