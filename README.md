Real Options Analysis in Go

This model is an example of how approximate dynamic programming can be used to value 
real options using Monte Carlo simulation. The example here is based on Schwartz (2004), see
the reference below. The algorithm uses is a variant of the Least Squares Monte Carlo (LSM) algorithm
from Longstaff & Schwartz (2001).
